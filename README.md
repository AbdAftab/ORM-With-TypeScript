# TypeScript ORM

Personal project meant to deepen my understanding of databases/ORMs specifically. Hoping to convert to cpp/Go so that I can be more comfortable in those languages.

Heavily referenced TypeORM, a bit of Prisma, and my old database course notes :)

## Features

- TypeScript-first design with strong typing
- Support for PostgreSQL (extensible for other databases)
- Decorator-based entity definitions
- Repository pattern for data access
- Query builder for complex queries
- Connection management

## Installation
Copy the repo onto your local machine and run:
```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

### Coming Soon

Examples will be provided soon.

## TODO

- Implement transactions
- Add migration support
